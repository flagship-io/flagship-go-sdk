## About Flagship

<img src="https://www.flagship.io/wp-content/uploads/Flagship-horizontal-black-wake-AB.png" alt="drawing" width="150"/>

[Flagship by AB Tasty](https://www.flagship.io/) is a feature flagging platform for modern engineering and product teams. It eliminates the risks of future releases by separating code deployments from these releases :bulb: With Flagship, you have full control over the release process. You can:

- Switch features on or off through remote config.
- Automatically roll-out your features gradually to monitor performance and gather feedback from your most relevant users.
- Roll back any feature should any issues arise while testing in production.
- Segment users by granting access to a feature based on certain user attributes.
- Carry out A/B tests by easily assigning feature variations to groups of users.

Flagship also allows you to choose whatever implementation method works for you from our many available SDKs or directly through a REST API. Additionally, our architecture is based on multi-cloud providers that offer high performance and highly-scalable managed services.
